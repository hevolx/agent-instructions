## Discovery Phase

Understand the requirement by asking (use AskUserQuestion if needed):

**Problem Statement**
- What problem does this solve?
- Who experiences this problem?
- What's the current pain point?

**Desired Outcome**
- What should happen after this is built?
- How will users interact with it?
- What does success look like?

**Scope & Constraints**
- What's in scope vs. out of scope?
- Any technical constraints?
- Dependencies on other systems/features?

**Context Check**
- Search codebase for related features/modules
- Check for existing test files that might be relevant
