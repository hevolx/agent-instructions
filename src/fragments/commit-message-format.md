## Commit Message Rules

Follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

1. **Format**: `type(#issue): description`
   - Use `#123` for local repo issues
   - Use `owner/repo#123` for cross-repo issues
   - Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

2. **AI Credits**: **NEVER include AI credits in commit messages**
   - No "Generated with Claude Code"
   - No "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or "Co-Authored-By: Happy"
   - Focus on the actual changes made, not conversation history

3. **Content**: Write clear, concise commit messages describing what changed and why
