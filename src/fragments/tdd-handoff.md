## Handoff to TDD

After planning:
1. Show summary of tasks/issues with IDs (if applicable)
2. Suggest TDD starting points for each task:
   - For each task, suggest the first test to write
   - Format: `/red "test description based on first acceptance criteria"`
   - Example: For "Add JWT validation", suggest `/red "test JWT token validation returns user ID"`
   - Include potentially relevant files for the work

Remind that we'll proceed with: `/red` → `/green` → `/refactor` cycles

**Ask**: "Ready to start with `/red` for the first test?"
